CPS353
I'm a Junior at Gordon College and I have next to no experience in web development other than creating a simple html page. For work I landscape about 10 hours a week and really enjoy the contrast in comparision to sitting at a desk.
The purpose of this repository is to store the code to a website that will developed in 5 stages over the course of this semester in Cps 353. This repository will contain all homework and project related materials to Cps 353.
